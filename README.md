| App | Package | Milestone | Status |
|-----|---------|-----------|--------|
| Operating Tracker | `@hae/operating-tracker` | 1 | Complete / Live |
| LMS (Academy) | `@hae/lms` | 2 | Built |
| Experts (EiR) | `@hae/eir` | 2 | Built (dynamic directory) |
| CRM | `@hae/crm` | 3 | Built |
| AMS | `@hae/ams` | 4 | Built |
| Platform insights | cross-app | **5** | In progress |

### Milestone 5 — Platform insights & ops polish

Cross-app improvements for feedback, awareness, and calendar handoff (Spark-safe; no Cloud Functions).

| Feature | Where | Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Survey analytics + CSV export | Tracker → Surveys → editor | Choice/rating breakdowns, text samples, CSV download |
| Notifications digest | Tracker → Notifications | Overdue / due-soon tasks + LMS check-ins; optional mailto digest |
| ICS calendar export | Tracker My Tasks, LMS Office Hours, AMS Events | Download `.ics` for Google/Apple/Outlook |

Later candidates (not in this slice): CRM↔AMS/LMS person linking, file attachments, password-reset UX, Blaze Functions for push email.
